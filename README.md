# Absenteeism


When measuring productivity of a department it is important to consider absenteeism. Whilst it is expected that some employees will be absent from work, it is necessary to know if a particular absence will likely lead to an extended time off work. 

Once predictions are made it will be possible to organise the rota in a more efficient way and distribute the workload more evenly.


The model splits absenteeism into four main categories:
-	Various types of diseases
-	Pregnancy related 
-	Poisoning or unclassified reasons
-	‘Light’ reasons such as dental appointments

Using this along with other inputs the model will predict, using logistic regression, how whether a specific absence will be an extended absence.
